# Install a package using the default npm registry without changing global configuration

```bash
npm install package-name --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

## To force verbose output with npm, you can use the --verbose flag in your npm command. This flag provides detailed information about the process that npm is running, which can be helpful for debugging or understanding what npm is doing under the hood.

```bash
npm install package-name --verbose
```
